# **House Price Prediction - Supervised Machine Learning Project**

## **Overview**
This project is an end-to-end supervised machine learning solution designed to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, location, size, and other relevant attributes. It serves as a demonstration of my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

The project uses the **California Housing Dataset** (or another dataset of your choice) and implements a regression model to predict house prices. It is a great example of how machine learning can be applied to solve real-world problems.

## **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scales features, and encodes categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Implements multiple regression models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² Score.
- **Deployment**: Includes a simple Flask API for making predictions.
- **Documentation**: Detailed README and comments in the code for easy understanding.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the **California Housing Dataset**, which contains information about housing prices in Boston. It includes features such as:
- `CRIM`: Per capita crime rate by town
- `RM`: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- `LSTAT`: Percentage of lower status of the population
- `MEDV`: Median value of owner-occupied homes (target variable)

---
## **Results**
- **Best Model**: Random Forest Regressor achieved an RÂ² score of 0.85 on the test set.
- **Visualization**: Actual vs Predicted prices are visualized using scatter plots.
